AtliQ Hospitality Analysis -Power BI
## Problem statement
Atliq Grands is a luxury hotel chain operating multiple five-star properties across India. Despite being in the hospitality industry for over 20 years, the company is facing challenges such as:

- Declining market share

- Reduced revenue in the luxury/business hotel segment

- Strong competition and strategic moves by rivals

- Ineffective data-driven decision-making

To regain market position and improve profitability, the management has decided to adopt Business & Data Intelligence practices. Since they lack an in-house analytics team, they partnered with a third-party provider to extract insights from historical business data.

### Project Objectives

As a Data Analyst, your primary responsibilities include:

- Create business performance metrics defined by the stakeholders
- Design and build a dashboard based on the provided mock-up
- Generate actionable business insights not explicitly included in the requirements

The goal is to help Atliq Grands make informed, data-driven decisions to improve occupancy rates, revenue, and competitive position.

### Key Performance Insights
‚úÖ Revenue & Business Performance

- Total revenue: ~1708M, showing a significant decline (-81.7%) ‚Äî indicating strong competitive pressure and weak demand.

- RevPAR increased by +27.8%, so revenue per available room has improved despite overall revenue fall ‚Äî suggests better pricing/yield strategy or fewer low-value rooms booked.

- ADR nearly flat (-0.2%), meaning average room rate stayed stable ‚Äî price strategy is consistent, drop is due to lower volume, not pricing.

- Realization % at 70.15% (+0.6%) ‚Äî guests are booking higher rate categories or upselling/offers working.

‚úÖ Occupancy & Demand

- Occupancy % is 57.87% (+28.1%) ‚Äî strong improvement in occupancy trend, but still moderate for luxury segment.

- Weekday ADR & RevPAR slightly lower than weekend, but weekend occupancy higher:

Atliq Exotica & Atliq Season ‚Äî strong revenue & ADR
