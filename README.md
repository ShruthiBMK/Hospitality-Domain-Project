# Hospitality-Domain-Project
AtliQ Hospitality Analysis -Power BI
## Problem statement
Atliq Grands is a luxury hotel chain operating multiple five-star properties across India. Despite being in the hospitality industry for over 20 years, the company is facing challenges such as:

- Declining market share

- Reduced revenue in the luxury/business hotel segment

- Strong competition and strategic moves by rivals

- Ineffective data-driven decision-making

To regain market position and improve profitability, the management has decided to adopt Business & Data Intelligence practices. Since they lack an in-house analytics team, they partnered with a third-party provider to extract insights from historical business data.

### Project Objectives

As a Data Analyst, your primary responsibilities include:

✅ Create business performance metrics defined by the stakeholders
✅ Design and build a dashboard based on the provided mock-up
✅ Generate actionable business insights not explicitly included in the requirements

The goal is to help Atliq Grands make informed, data-driven decisions to improve occupancy rates, revenue, and competitive position.
